Lantern Recipe
=====================

This project uses the ionic framework. http://ionicframework.com/
Ionic Crash Course: http://tinyurl.com/lwzojd3

Please note that this project makes use of sass for custom styling. Review the "Using Sass" section below. Reference: http://sass-lang.com/guide

You may need to run `$ sudo` with some of the installation instructions.

It is highly recommended that UI development be run through a local web server. Just point your virtual server to the 'www' project folder.
Fire up `$ gulp watch` and edit the 'scss/ionic.app.scss' for css styling and off you go.

For RFduino integration and development you will have to deploy to your device (not a simulator).
For debugging phonegap mobile app development this project uses **weinre** http://tinyurl.com/6quwfna







## Using this project

We recommend using the `ionic` utility to create new Ionic projects that are based on this project but use a ready-made starter template.

For example, to start a new Ionic project with the default tabs interface, make sure the `ionic` utility is installed:

```bash
$ sudo npm install -g ionic
```

Then run:

```bash
$ sudo npm install -g ionic
$ ionic start myProject tabs
```

More info on this can be found on the Ionic [Getting Started](http://ionicframework.com/getting-started) page.

## Installation

While we recommend using the `ionic` utility to create new Ionic projects, you can use this repo as a barebones starting point to your next Ionic app.

To use this project as is, first clone the repo from GitHub, then run:

```bash
$ cd lanternRecipe
$ sudo npm install -g cordova ionic gulp
$ npm install
$ gulp init
```

## Using Sass (optional)

This project makes it easy to use Sass (the SCSS syntax) in your projects. This enables you to override styles from Ionic, and benefit from
Sass's great features.

Just update the `./scss/ionic.app.scss` file, and run `gulp` or `gulp watch` to rebuild the CSS files for Ionic.

Note: if you choose to use the Sass method, make sure to remove the included `ionic.css` file in `index.html`, and then uncomment
the include to your `ionic.app.css` file which now contains all your Sass code and Ionic itself:

```html
<!-- IF using Sass (run gulp sass first), then remove the CSS include above
<link href="css/ionic.app.css" rel="stylesheet">
-->
```
